# Ethical Considerations

1. **Respect for Website Terms and Conditions:**
   - Before scraping weather-forecast.com, we ensured that scraping is allowed by checking the robots.txt file.
   - The script has built-in rate limiting to avoid overloading the website with too many requests in a short amount of time.

2. **Data Privacy:**
   - No personal data is scraped or processed in this project. All information is related to public flight data and publicly available weather forecasts.

3. **Fair Use of Free APIs:**
   - The AviationStack API is used within the limits of its free plan to gather non-sensitive public flight data.

4. **Transparency:**
   - Clear documentation has been provided to ensure users are aware of the data being collected and its intended use.
